<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Upon entering the home screen, the user can carry out three choices: 
* Mental Health - a chat thread dedicated to all things mental health. Tell the app how you're feeling right now and it will automatically match you with someone who shares similar sentiments.
* Just Chat - a general chat thread. Again, tell the app what you want to talk about and it will do its best to match you with a conversation partner with similar interests.
* Connect Me with Hotlines - a collection of important contacts in case you ever need them.
