Our project, called VenTalk, started to come to life using the framework of React Native. With this, we were able to implement our design ideas that we had drafted through Figma.

For the backend, we used NODEjs coupled with the socket.io module. This was uploaded to Google cloud, to allow anyone to try it out. 

To achieve accurate matching of people, we used Dandelion's API which has string comparison, giving a score of how similar the strings are. This was implemented into our algorithm
which allowed us to give priority to those who joined first as a record of that was kept whenever someone conneted to the service.
